1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 c5 5. dxc5 Bxc5 6. Nf3 Qb6 {the only move where Bxc5 doesn't just lose a tempo--black wants to force white to shut in his queen's bishop} 7. e3 Qc7 8. b3 b6 9. Bb2 a6 10. Be2 {defending Nf3 in preparation for g4} Bb7 11. g4 {black is to have to castle long, and white will do the same. g4 grabs space and forces black's pieces back to passive positions}
